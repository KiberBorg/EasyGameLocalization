# Easy Game Localization
This is an add-on for Google Spreadsheets which can be helpful if you want to use spreadsheets for game localization. 
If you have the following set-up:
![Alt text](/img/ScreenshotSet-up.png?raw=true "Spreadsheet Set-Up")

So you have your variable identifiers in column 1 on the left, these will be completely ignored. Column 2 has your main language in it. In row 1 the language code (i.e. de, en, fr, it, es) and then all the words in your main (source) language for the variable identifiers. On top of all the other columns you can now put the language codes for all the other languages you want to have in your game. (You can get the codes from the select box in the add-on)
If you hit 'Translate' it will now fill in the translation of the source language word in the same row for all of the languages. Example:

![Alt text](/img/Screenshot1.png?raw=true "Spreadsheet Set-Up")

If you can't live with that set-up it might be worth checking out the add-on this was forked from.
